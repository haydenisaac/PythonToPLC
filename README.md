About:
We're using python as an interpreter so that the PLC can communicate between the Mobile Industrial Robots. 
The aim of this project is to be able to control a fleet of MiRs just using the PLC. This involves sending and retrieving information from the MiRs API.
The current set up has two pallet stations, to collect/drop off a full pallet of 'Product', at opposite ends of the workshop. There will be a variety of missions
to be sent from the HMI to the MiR's fleet software.

Run:
To use run main.py and wait unit it has imported all of the packages and is ready. At this point it should accept inputs from the HMI/PLC, process them and send the information
to the fleet manager. While it also updates the PLC on the status of the MiR
